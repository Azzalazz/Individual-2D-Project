# Galaxy Striker 
Galaxy Striker is a 2D arcade-style shooting game where the player controls a spaceship that can
move between three lanes (left, middle, and right) while shooting incoming enemies. The
goal is to survive as long as possible while achieving a
high score. Enemies advance slowly toward the player's
ship, and each enemy has a different life total. If the
player’s bullets hit an enemy, they destroy it or push
it back depending on how much life remains. The game
gets progressively harder as new waves of stronger
enemies are introduced. Every 30 seconds, the game gets increasingly difficult. 
When the enemies hit "earth" the player loses a life (the player has a total of 3 lives. 

○ Left (A): Move the ship to the left lane.
○ Right (D): Move the ship to the right lane.
○ Middle (S): Move the ship back to the center lane.
● Shooting:
○ Spacebar: Fire projectiles toward enemies in the current lane. Shots deduct from
enemy life points. When the life total reaches 0, the enemy is destroyed.

1. The player starts with full health and can immediately move between the three lanes and
shoot.
2. Waves of enemies begin to approach from the top of the screen, slowly moving down
toward the player's ship.
3. The player shoots enemies in the active lane using the spacebar. If an enemy is hit, its
health decreases, and it might be pushed back up the screen.
4. Enemies have different health levels, with some being destroyed faster and others
needing multiple hits to defeat.
5. The game becomes progressively harder with more enemies, faster movement, and
stronger ships in later waves.
6. The game ends when an enemy reaches the player’s position, and the player's ship is
destroyed.
